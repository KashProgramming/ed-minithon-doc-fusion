# Bytecoders - File Consolidation and Handling

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a system where users can upload files such as PDFs, Word documents (DOCX), or PowerPoint presentations (PPTs). Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the system will consolidate the content from these files into a single, streamlined document. This consolidated document will contain all the essential information while removing redundant or repeated parts, making it more concise and easier to read.

Additionally, the project includes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot** that interacts with the user, allowing them to ask questions about the consolidated content. 

The final system will be deployed using **Docker** for environment consistency and **Vercel** for hosting.
