      "CO2 Emission Calculation\n",
      "Formula for CO2 Emissions:\n",
      "CO2 Emissions (in kg) is calculated using the following formula:\n",
      "CO2 Emissions (kg) = (Distance Traveled (km) รท Mileage (km/l)) ร Carbon Factor (kg/km)\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "Distance Traveled: This is the total distance of the route in kilometers.\n",
      "Mileage: This represents the vehicle's fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter (km/l).\n",
      "Carbon Factor: This is the average emissions produced per kilometer for the specific fuel type, measured in kilograms per kilometer (kg/km).\n",
      "Tree Calculation\n",
      "Formula for Number of Trees:\n",
      "The number of trees required to absorb the calculated CO2 emissions is estimated using:\n",
      "Number of Trees = CO2 Emissions (kg) รท 22\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "This formula estimates how many mature trees are needed to offset the total CO2 emissions produced by the vehicle during its journey, assuming that one mature tree can absorb approximately 22 kg of CO2 per year.\n",
